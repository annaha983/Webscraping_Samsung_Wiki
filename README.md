# Webscraping_Samsung_Wiki
This is a simple python web scraping project. BeautifulSoup was used to scrape information off of the Samsung Wikipedia page, format it into lists, and then into data frames with Pandas. Three separate data frames were created and were exported into different sheets of the same excel document.
